  "aboutItems": [
    "I am a veteran front end software engineer with considerable full stack development experience. I am most comfortable with JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS in various environments, including Node.js, PHP, Java, Ruby on Rails, and .NET.",
    "I recently spent a year contracting with an Etsy team to facilitate server-side rendering of React component islands, able to communicate through a shared Redux store. This helped product engineers to provide enhanced user experiences for Etsy customers, while still maintaining fast page load times, through on-demand hydration of static content with interactive features.",
    "In the months since Etsy, I have focused mostly on my own business, WebEquate. I have been rebuilding websites previously built with PHP and MySQL, instead using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and MongoDB, to modernize my development workflow, streamline site updates, and improve site performance.",
    "Now I am seeking a new opportunity as a Front End Software Engineer or Full Stack Software Engineer, with a strong preference for fully remote roles.",
    "I also enjoy travel, hiking, photography, electronic music, and foreign languages."
