Allen took on the additional challenge of being the ScrumMaster for our UI team as the team grew and made sure the processes allowed for the most benefit to the company. I recommend Allen not only for his technical abilities but also as a team member and someone that can improve a company.",

Our medical insurance site has more than a million registered users. Allen had a detailed knowledge of CSS and HTML. I think his programming background gave him special understanding of how CSS and HTML works and can be coded. We were disappointed to see him leave!",
